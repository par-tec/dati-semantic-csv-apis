  # Controlled Vocabulary of Causal Agents - INAIL Classification

  Decodifica dell'agente, lavorazione, o esposizione che puo'
  essere causa o
  concausa di malattia.

  Decoding of the agent, processing, or aspect that can cause
  or contribute to
  disease.

  This is a tabular representation of the SKOS-based controlled
  vocabulary
  adopted by INAIL

  (Istituto Nazionale per l'Assicurazione contro gli Infortuni
  sul Lavoro) for
  classifying

  causal agents in occupational accidents and diseases.
